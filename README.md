# Python Exam 2

It consists of 4 jupyter notebooks. Each one has a coding problem that must be written.
When the code is written correctly, the unit test at the bottom of the notebook will
complete with no errors of any kind.

Normal rules: you may not consult with any other person on this exam, and you cannot use
anyone else's code or solutions to these problem. You may google, if you need to, to complete
them.

Obviously, with four parts, and only a few tests, grading is going be interesting.

Part 1 : 12 tests
Part 2 : 9 tests
Part 3 : 4 tests
Part 4 : 5 tests

You must get at least one of the parts correct to pass. But at this point,
we tend to think you should be able to do 3 of the 4, no matter what, in the time period given.
